## What is raspberry pi?
The `Raspberry Pi ðŸ¥§`  is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. It is a capable little device that enables people of all ages to explore computing, and to learn how to program in languages like Scratch and Python. Itâ€™s capable of doing everything youâ€™d expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word-processing, and playing games. 

Whatâ€™s more, the `Raspberry Pi ðŸ¥§` has the ability to interact with the outside world, and has been used in a wide array of digital maker projects, from music machines and parent detectors to weather stations and tweeting birdhouses with infra-red cameras. We want to see the Raspberry Pi being used by kids all over the world to learn to program and understand how computers work.

## What can you do with `Raspberry Pi ðŸ¥§`? :

- Use raspberry Pi as a dekstop computer
- Learn basic programming 
- Server for MQTT
- Retro Gaming Machine
- Web Server

**Any many more**

There are many type of `Raspberry Pi ðŸ¥§`
